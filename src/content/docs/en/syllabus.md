## Course Overview

The AI industry of 2025–2026 has decisively shifted from conversational models to **autonomous agentic systems**. This course is organized around two central themes: **harness engineering** — the discipline of controlling non-deterministic AI agents with deterministic systems — and the **Human-on-the-Loop (HOTL)** paradigm, in which humans take on strategic oversight rather than step-by-step approval.

Students will directly operate the NVIDIA DGX H100 server in the Jeju Halla University AI Lab (partitioned via MIG technology), gaining hands-on experience deploying and running open-source models such as **DeepSeek-Coder-V2** without relying on commercial APIs. The ultimate goal is to design an autonomous software development pipeline (multi-agent SDLC) and implement it in the capstone project **Ralphthon**.

## Learning Objectives

Upon completing this course, students will be able to:

1. Explain the differences among HITL, HOTL, and HIC governance architectures and implement them as Governance-as-Code
2. Design and implement harness engineering systems using the Ralph Loop methodology
3. Optimize long-running agent loops through context window management and instruction tuning
4. Build a multi-agent SDLC by connecting planner, coder, and QA agents via MCP
5. Deploy open-source LLMs in a DGX H100 + MIG + vLLM environment and measure their performance
6. Automatically evaluate the quality of agent systems using LLM-as-Judge and telemetry
